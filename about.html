    Hello. I'm Joel. I'm a software developer. I Code for Miami, and Code for America.
    In my free time I also like to shoot pics with my Nikon camera.
    I currently live in Miami USA, where I'm almost the only developer over here.
    On the photo above, my friend Paul caught me by surprise while I was coding, heh.
