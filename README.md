# Space Jekyll

A simple and elegant Jekyll theme based on Spacemacs. The theme works well on mobile devices as well.

## Installing & Starting Dev Server

For jekyll dependency installation:
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/

Use node version < 12, or gulp version < 3.

Recommend install `nvm` for multiple node version management. This project will not be updated as much so using an older version works for now.

Then, run
```
npm start
```
on project folder.
