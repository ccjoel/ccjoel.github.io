I am drunk with art. My lungs are filled with romantic melodies, which I sing while making myself some pancakes for breakfast.

I met this woman two weeks ago. She is tall, dark haired, has green eyes and an incredible smile- my
type of woman. My housemate invited her to stay over, with some other girl friends. We were planning
on going to the Daytona 500 over the weekend. We started a house party, with me practicing cocktail
making since that’s my thing now. We got so drunk… what a fun night. We even did drunk yoga (patent
pending).

At the end of the night we ended up making out. She is in some kind of complicated relationship with a guy, which would be okay if I didn’t know the guy. Which would also be okay if it wasn’t any relevant whatsoever. This guy turns out to be my housemate’s best friend.

So the rest of the weekend I behaved myself, taking advantage of every chance I got to lose myself into her eyes. I made her laugh and flirted from time to time, only to then realize that my friend was there checking on me. At the time I tried very hard to behave myself, even sabotaging myself, so I wouldn’t hit on her. My “dark” player days were supposed to be buried, deep in the past.

She went back to her town after the weekend was over- just four beautiful hours away from here. I said to myself- “Well, I did it. I'm under control!” (when not influenced by alcohol... -_-’ ). Then she added me on facebook. Then we started chatting most days. I am just trying to play innocent, but I know that her scent stayed on my skin and as much as I try the flavor of her lips won’t go away (I want more!). Then she told me to visit her and stay over at her parent’s house, where she lives.

I am trying very hard to not mess things up. I have my housemate and his friendship, which I wouldn’t
want to destroy. And this couldn’t be something serious since she doesn’t live that close. So I told her that I couldn’t. That I’m a little bit dangerous since she has someone (and I won’t really care… I’ll go for it).

Don’t judge me. I am like that. I prefer not to put myself in those situations because I know that I’ll be weak. So instead I just evade them. And I have grown to be a little bit more responsible than when I was in college. Well… that might be a lie...

Today she sent me some messages. We ended talking a little bit more about what happened. She says
that we can resist temptation and we can be friends and I should be able to visit. That I shouldn’t worry.

I know myself. I love challenges. I should know better.

I also told her about a song that all this “yolo come here and visit me” situation reminded me of. Well, just one line from “We can work it out” by the Beatles: Life is very short, and there’s no time”… Then I told her about some other artists I have on my playlist and she said something like: “Robi Draco, with that one only it’s enough….”

He turns out to be OUR favorite artist! I don’t know why this is so relevant. I end up playing his songs ([Mad Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDf8YsiAulQ)) and here I am. Because of his lyrics I am madly in love and dancing and falling over, chest first. I have been trying really hard to ignore it... but each time I pronounce her name in my mind, I fail to understand how bewitched I am. Come on! I am drawing happy faces with syrup, on the pancakes.

And as I slowly sip my coffee, all I can think is how excitig life is.

Because this coffee tastes like luck. Because this breakfast tastes like life. And maannn, do these
pancakes taste like glory.
