Everyone is aware of the recent events that have shaken the world. I, for one,
was ready for a career change. When the companies I interviewed for froze their
positions, due to the economic uncertainity the pandemic brought, I ended up
with no work on a great sabbatical to discover new technologies and share some time
with my new family.

I had to go through one or two interview processess this summer. Even though the
roles weren't an exact fit with my skills and desires, I ended up building these
demos of what I can accomplish with JavaScript and CSS on the browser.

Here's the result of my exercise of hosting and collecting these demo applications.
Actually, I have included some previous ones that may have landed me a job.

## Demos

All of these applications are embedded with iframes, except for the windrose,
which is a screenshot. Try them out!

### Meet The Pokedex

I was given barebones mockups and asked to develop a pokedex using <https://pokeapi.co/>.
It was required to use VueJs. It was my first time using this library/framework. Link to standalone [Pokedex](https://teh0xqb.com:444) .

<div class="demo-container">
    <iframe class="demo" src="https://teh0xqb.com:444" title="Pokedex" width="100%"></iframe> 
</div>

Some notes on what I tried to accomplish:
The data fetching has one central source of truth. I did not have time to create a "connection" singleton,
so I used the Vue global store to both store app data and link to the pokeapi endpoints. This way, anytime
a component fetched data the application would be aware of it. With this information, this pokedex has an app-level
loading animation. It is a little bit hidden below the pokedex header. That's the point: on slow connections,
you'll see the loading animation. On faster internet connections, you don't really need to notice it (nor have previous
content immediately replaced or yanky flashes of animations from requests that took a small amount of time).

This application is fully responsive- try it out under several browser sizes. I used
flex and grid displays, with em values in order for it to work and resize appropriatedly.
It is not exactly optimized for mobile, but any desktop window will do.

### Meet the Pivot Table

React demo page with a Pivot Table component. The table receives linear data and 
row/column dimension configuration. Suppports multiple dimensions.
Aggreages data and sums sales.

### Meet the OpsRing

I built this in 2015. Hence I took a simple approach.
No view library, jQuery, nor framework. No babel.
Just javascript, D3js, and webpack in order to require dependencies.

### Meet the React Registration Page

With a simplest validation implementation with React using the HTML Constraint Validation API.

### Meet the WindRose

Ended up building this While working with D3js, back in 2014.

### Meet the ClojureScript + Material-UI Demo App

Utilizes cljs-http to use core.async channels for http calls. Uses [material-ui](https://v4-9-14.material-ui.com/)
components, although it was exactly necessary. I just wanted test npm libraries
within the clojurescript ecosystem.
