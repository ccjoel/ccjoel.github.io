## Demos

All of these applications are embedded with iframes, except for the windrose, which is a screenshot. Try them out!

### Meet The Pokedex

I was given a wireframe (all gray blocks) and asked to develop a pokedex using <https://pokeapi.co/>.
It was required to use VueJs. It was my first time using this library/framework. Link to standalone [Pokedex](https://teh0xqb.com:444) .

<div class="demo-container">
    <iframe class="demo" src="https://teh0xqb.com:444" title="Pokedex" width="100%" />
</div>

Some notes on what I tried to accomplish:
On the source code, there's one central source of truth. I did not have time to create a "connection" singleton,
so I used the Vue global store to both store app data and link to the pokeapi endpoints. This way, anytime
a component fetched data the application would be aware of it. With this information, this pokedex has an app-level
loading animation. It is a little bit hidden below the pokedex header. That's the point: in fast connections,
you'll see the loading animation running and loading. In fast internet connections, you don't really need to notice it.

This application is fully responsive- try it out under several browser sizes. I used
flex and grid displays, with em values in order for it to work and resize appropriatedly.
It is not exactly optimized for mobile, but any desktop window will do.

### Meet the OpsRing

I built this in 2015. Hence I took a simple approach.
No view library, jQuery, nor framework. No babel.
Just javascript, D3js, and webpack in order to require dependencies.

Ended up building this While working with D3js, back in 2014.

### Meet the ClojureScript + Material-UI Demo App

Utilizes cljs-http to use core.async channels for http calls. Uses [material-ui](https://v4-9-14.material-ui.com/)
components, although it was exactly necessary. I just wanted test npm libraries
within the clojurescript ecosystem.
