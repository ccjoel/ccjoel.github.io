There are a lot of popular ways of saying it. Life gives you signals. Stars and planets aligned. I was ‘one’ with nature. God was by my side. No matter which one you choose to use, if any, I believe that it happened to me today.

A very important person in my life is a step closer to forgiving me. Maybe... understanding me. That doesn’t mean that it has happened, or that everything will go back to the way things were , but I saw a glimpse of light, after all hope was almost lost. Besides that, today I met someone which I’d seen before but had never talked to directly. He just asked
me if he could sit on my table during lunch, since there were no others chairs around. I was done making my daily calls, so we just started a nice little chat. That’s an understatement. No, really!

After talking a little about us, where we were from, what we were doing at the company, and similar topics, he mentioned he was a contractor, and that he had a group of people which did like projects on the side for some extra money. Say what!? In a previous post, which was YESTERDAY, I was telling to the random internet reader, or maybe asking life, what I wanted. I wanted to meet a team that resembled any of several characteristics. And he just told me he met in the evenings for his side projects with some people. So... we explained our vision of life and how it came to be. And I told him about yesterday’s post, and how everything appeared to be all connected.

How can I say this without getting over-excited!? That is some recursive #(*^)! I write a post, then this occurs the following day. So we talked about that. He told me something really interesting (I have to read about it btw), and it was something along the lines of "writing brings things you want towards you".

This reminds me of a novel I read a while back. I read it like 3 or 4 times in total. And the message I learned from it was: learn to follow the signals that life gives you. And I fear that this person was just an angel, and that I wont be able to see him again. Luckily for me, I saved his number.
